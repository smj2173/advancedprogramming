Please answer the academic honesty questions.

[1] YES, because then you cannot independently come to a conclusion about the
answer; one's answer will be informed and directed by the tutor's leading
questions and assistance.

[2] YES, sending screenshots of work is an example of looking directly at
one's code and then you will not be able to separate how you solve the problem
from how they approached it.

[3] YES, because you have them in your possession and were planning on using
them.

[4]
	[a] NO, because you are discussing class material collaboratively rather than sharing/discussing solutions.
	[b] YES, because you are discussing class solutions that should be solved individually.
	[c] NO, because this is a question about the learning objectives of the assignment rather than the actual content/solutions of/to the lab.

[5] YES, because even if you do not use any of the code in your submission,
you referenced material that you were not authorized to reference and examine
when working on the assignment.

[6] NO, because you are simply try to understand what an error means and how
to approach resolving it.

[7] YES, because you are referencing code you are not intended to look at and
that not everyone has access to.
