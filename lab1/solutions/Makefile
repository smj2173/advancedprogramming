# This Makefile should be used as a template for future
# Makefiles.  It's heavily commented, so hopefully you can
# understand what each line does.  If anything is unclear,
# please ask in the mailing list, in office hours, or in
# class.

# We'll use gcc for C compilation and g++ for C++ compilation

CC  = gcc
CXX = g++

# Let's leave a place holder for additional include directories

INCLUDES =

# Compilation options:
# -g for debugging info and -Wall enables all warnings

CFLAGS   = -g -Wall $(INCLUDES)
CXXFLAGS = -g -Wall $(INCLUDES)

# Linking options:
# -g for debugging info

LDFLAGS = -g

# List the libraries you need to link with in LDLIBS
# For example, use "-lm" for the math library
# if you used sqrt() function.

LDLIBS = -lm

# The 1st target gets built when you type "make".
# It's usually your executable.  ("main" in this case.)
#
# Note that we did not specify the linking rule.
# Instead, we rely on one of make's implicit rules:
#
#     $(CC) $(LDFLAGS) <all-dependent-.o-files> $(LDLIBS)
#
# Also note that make assumes that main depends on main.o,
# so we can omit it.

main: prime.o gcd.o

# We say that main.o depends on prime.h and gcd.h
# (because main.c includes them).  Now, main.o will get
# recompiled if either of the header files get modified.
#
# make already knows main.o depends on main.c, so we don't
# have to say it.  make uses the following implicit rule
# to compile a .c file into a .o file:
#
#     $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) <the-.c-file>
#

main.o: prime.h gcd.h

# And prime.o and gcd.o depend on their own .h files.
# Again, make knows they also depend on the .c files.

prime.o: prime.h

gcd.o: gcd.h

# Always provide the "clean" target that removes intermediate files.
# What you remove depend on your choice of coding tools
# (different editors generate different backup files for example).
#
# And the "clean" target is not a file name, so we tell make that
# it's a "phony" target.

.PHONY: clean
clean:
	rm -f *.o a.out core main

# "all" target is useful if your Makefile builds multiple programs.
# Here we'll have it first do "clean", and rebuild the main target.

.PHONY: all
all: clean main
